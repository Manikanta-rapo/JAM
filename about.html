That’s exactly what an effective travel website should make you feel. It should activate the travel bug with vibrant imagery and vivid copy.

And while photos can do a lot of the work in inspiring visitors, a travel site can’t accomplish its purpose without great web design.

Web design plays a major role in visitors’ first impressions of a business. In fact, in one study, when participants were asked why they distrusted a website, 94% of the comments were about design.

For a travel site, this means that design can be the determining factor in whether a visitor trusts recommendations and information.

And considering the significant investments that go into planning a trip, trust is essential.

It can make or break a traveler’s decision to take a certain tour, stay at a certain hotel, or even visit a city or country altogether.

Plus, beyond serving as a trustworthy source of inspiration, a travel site also needs to give would-be travelers all the information they need to arrange their travel plans.

Once a visitor is convinced that they need to see the sights in the photos for themselves, it should be easy for them to plan their trip.

This means that the site needs to have straightforward travel information, helpful logistical details, and tips that will help visitors simplify the travel process.

Not all travel sites tick all of these boxes, but the ones that do stand out from all the rest.

So whether you’re considering launching a new travel site, or you’re ready to improve an existing one, you want to make sure you leave no stone unturned.

That’s why in this post, I’ll cover the essential elements your site needs to include, then go over 20 examples of travel sites you can use to inspire your own design.

What should a travel website include?
There are tons of different types of sites that fall under the travel site umbrella.

The design elements you need depend on the type of site you’re running.

An official tourism site for a city will have different goals from those of a travel blogger or tour company.

So as you read through this post, keep in mind that not all of the recommendations will apply to your site.

But in general, the ideal travel website should include a mix of the following:

High-quality photography
A brief summary of the area, with highlights of important places
Hotel recommendations with web links to hotel and booking sites
Information about recreation and outdoor activities
Guides to arts and culture, including museums, theaters, and other attractions
Packing tips
Maps and guides
Public transport information
Airport information
Relevant tips on language and local dialect</pre></div>
